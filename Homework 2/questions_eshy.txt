1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?

The command "cd" changes the current directory, "pwd" prints the working directory, and "mkdir" creates a new directory. The terminal itself is probably written in C/C++. The language the aforementioned commands belond to is shell script.

2. Do you have pets? What kind?

No I do not. I do want a cat, though! I'll probably get one when I have the time to take care of it.

3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?

Googling the error and reading the stack overflow result on it.

4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.

It didn't exactly "happen to me," but my friends and I blew up a pipe by stuffing food into it on a rainy day during lunch.

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)

It is a bunch of python commands that can be run on your computer.
